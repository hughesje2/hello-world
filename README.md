# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub.
Hi - my name is Jenny and I am a 25 year old college grad currently traveling the world. I am expanding my skill set by taking a coursera course on data science. This is the beginning of the course but in 5 months time I hope to have it completed and have a base knowledge of R programming and whether I want to pursue data science further. Currently have zero programming experience and looking forward to getting started.
